# RUNI Auto Reloader

A simple, lightweight Chrome extension that automatically reloads pages for Reichman University (RUNI) websites to prevent frustrating session timeouts.

## About The Project

This extension was created for RUNI students who often get logged out of key university websites like Moodle, Yedion, or the personal information portal (My RUNI) during long study sessions. It runs quietly in the background, reloading these pages every 15 minutes to keep your session active.

### Supported Websites
* Moodle (`moodle.runi.ac.il`)
* Yedion (`yedion.runi.ac.il`)
* My RUNI (`my.runi.ac.il`)

## Features

* **Automatic Reloads:** Reloads pages every 15 minutes.
* **Zero Configuration:** Just install it, and it works instantly. No settings required.
* **Lightweight:** Runs efficiently in the background without slowing down your browser.
* **Specific Targeting:** Only affects the RUNI websites listed above.

## Installation Guide

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you need to load it manually. It only takes a minute.

1.  **Download the Code**
    * On the main page of this repository, click the green `<> Code` button.
    * Select `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu.

2.  **Unzip the File**
    * Find the downloaded `.zip` file on your computer and unzip it. You will now have a folder likely named `runi-auto-reloader-main`.

3.  **Open Browser Extensions Page**
    * Open your Chrome (or Brave) browser and navigate to the extensions management page by typing this into your address bar: `chrome://extensions`

4.  **Enable Developer Mode**
    * In the top-right corner of the extensions page, find the **Developer mode** toggle switch and turn it **on**.

5.  **Load the Extension**
    * A new set of buttons will appear on the left. Click on **Load unpacked**.
    * A file selection window will open. Navigate to the folder you unzipped in Step 2 (e.g., `runi-auto-reloader-main`) and select it.

The "RUNI Auto Reloader" extension will now appear in your list of extensions and is active immediately.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension works automatically. You don't need to do anything. It will handle reloading the relevant tabs in the background.
